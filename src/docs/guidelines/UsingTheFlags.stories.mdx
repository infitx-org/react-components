## Using the flags

The SCSS version of the styles exposes a set of configurable flags, which some components will react to and change their look upon that.


#### Theme flags

When setting the themed-* flags, the input fields will change their default and themed appearance.

They will set a themed border appearance on the flagged borders, and keep a default appearance on the other ones.

The individual borders are choosen by setting `true/false` on the following

- `$themed-border-top` - `true/false`
- `$themed-border-bottom` - `true/false`
- `$themed-border-left` - `true/false`
- `$themed-border-right` - `true/false`

The default and themed appearance is set with:

- `$border-width--default`: 1px;
- `$border-width--themed`: 2px;
- `$border-color--default`: #e5e5e5
- `$border-color--themed`: colors.$primary

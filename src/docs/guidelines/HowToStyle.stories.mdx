### Using SCSS

The easiest and most powerful way is to use SCSS.

You can import variables and themes and use them with minimal effort, without worrying about anything else.

Simply import the entrypoint `@modusbox/react-components/lib/index.scss` and you are ready to go.

```css
@import "@modusbox/react-components/lib/index.scss";

.box {
  background: colors.$primary;
}
```
<Box size="small" style={{background: `var(--color__primary)`}} />

**Note**: You shouldn't be including the `index.scss` module more than once, as that could lead to duplicated classnames in your bundle.css.

If your target is to adopt a fully modular system, only import the scss modules you need with the variables for the scope.

### Using CSS

Import the CSS bundle

```tsx
// component file .js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx
import "@modusbox/react-components/lib/index.css";
```

Use the variable in your stylesheet

```css
// component style .css / .scss
.box {
  background: var(--color__primary);
}
```
<Box size="small" style={{background: `var(--color__primary)`}} />


The biggest difference between the 2 options is that if using SCSS you will be able to apply a custom theme by overriding the variables.
